Generic interface for JWT producing classes.

## Methods

### setAudience()

▸ **setAudience**(`audience`): `this`

Set the "aud" (Audience) Claim.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| `audience` | `string` \| `string`[] | "aud" (Audience) Claim value to set on the JWT Claims Set. |

#### Returns

`this`

***

### setExpirationTime()

▸ **setExpirationTime**(`input`): `this`

Set the "exp" (Expiration Time) Claim.

- If a `number` is passed as an argument it is used as the claim directly.
- If a `Date` instance is passed as an argument it is converted to unix timestamp and used as the
  claim.
- If a `string` is passed as an argument it is resolved to a time span, and then added to the
  current unix timestamp and used as the claim.

Format used for time span should be a number followed by a unit, such as "5 minutes" or "1
day".

Valid units are: "sec", "secs", "second", "seconds", "s", "minute", "minutes", "min", "mins",
"m", "hour", "hours", "hr", "hrs", "h", "day", "days", "d", "week", "weeks", "w", "year",
"years", "yr", "yrs", and "y". It is not possible to specify months. 365.25 days is used as an
alias for a year.

If the string is suffixed with "ago", or prefixed with a "-", the resulting time span gets
subtracted from the current unix timestamp. A "from now" suffix can also be used for
readability when adding to the current unix timestamp.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| `input` | `string` \| `number` \| [`Date`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) | "exp" (Expiration Time) Claim value to set on the JWT Claims Set. |

#### Returns

`this`

- If a `Date` instance is passed as an argument it is converted to unix timestamp and used as the
  claim.
- If a `string` is passed as an argument it is resolved to a time span, and then added to the
